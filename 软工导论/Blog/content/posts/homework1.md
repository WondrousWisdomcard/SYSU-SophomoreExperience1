## 关键词解释 from Wikipedia

### Computer：
A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations **automatically**. 

### Computer Science：
Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. 

### Software：
Computer software, or simply software, is a part of a computer system that consists of data or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.

### Software Engineering：
Software engineering (SWE) is the application of engineering to the development of software in a systematic method.

### Alan Turing:
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher and theoretical biologist.
He was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.
Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.

### Moore’s Law:
Moore’s Law A term that dignifies the trend, first recognised by George E Moore, co-founder of Intel, in 1965, that the number of transistors on integrated circuits doubles about every two years.
