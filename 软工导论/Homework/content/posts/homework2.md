## 进制转换

1分12秒 等于 7200毫秒

(7A)<sub>13</sub> = (101)<sub>10</sub>

(7A)<sub>16</sub> = (122)<sub>10</sub>

(7A)<sub>16</sub> = (1111010)<sub>2</sub> = (172)<sub>8</sub>

(1011011)<sub>2</sub> = (133)<sub>8</sub> = (5B)<sub>16</sub>

(678)<sub>10</sub> = (1010100110)<sub>2</sub> = (1246)<sub>8</sub>

(111)<sub>2</sub> + (101)<sub>2</sub> = (1100)<sub>2</sub> 


## 关键词解释 from Wikipedia

### Information
At its most fundamental level, information is any propagation of cause and effect within a system. Information is conveyed either as the content of a message or through direct or indirect observation of anything.

### Position notation
Positional notation is a method of representing or encoding numbers. Positional notation is distinguished from other notations (such as Roman numerals) for its use of the same symbol for the different orders of magnitude (for example, the "ones place", "tens place", "hundreds place"). This greatly simplified arithmetic, leading to the rapid spread of the notation across the world.

### Algorithm 
In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained step-by-step set of operations to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.
**Usually, a good algorithm has five characteristics:**

**Input**: The algorithm has at least zero or more inputs.

**Output**: The algorithm has at least one or more outputs

**Certainty**: Every step in the algorithm has a certain meaning and no ambiguity

**Feasibility**: Every step of the algorithm is feasible and can be implemented in the current environment.

**Limitation**: The algorithm ends automatically after a limited number of steps without infinite loops, and each step can be completed in an acceptable amount of time.

### Software bug
A software bug is an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.
