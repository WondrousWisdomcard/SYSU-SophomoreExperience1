# Lab Work 06-1. Balance Rotations of AVL Trees

### Lab Work 06-1. Balance Rotations of AVL Trees

**Note**: Programming in C

An AVL tree is a binary search tree where every node in the tree has a balance factor of -1, 0 or +1. But any insertion into the AVL tree may cause violations of balance in four cases: Left-Left, Left-Right, Right-Right, and Right-Left. Single Rotations and Double Rotations are introduced to fix these cases.

1. Determine the data structures for an AVL tree
2. Implement an insertion into the AVL tree
3. Implement the four possible rotations to fix violations of balance caused by the insertion.
