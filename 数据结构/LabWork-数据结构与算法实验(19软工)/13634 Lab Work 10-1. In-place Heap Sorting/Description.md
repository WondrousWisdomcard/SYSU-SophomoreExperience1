### Lab Work 10-1. In-place Heap Sorting

**Note:** Programming in C

1. Determine the array structures for a complete max-heap
2. Input a linear list of 20 random numbers, building a complete max-heap to store the numbers by the process of in-place heapification
3. Implement an in-place sorting, making use of POP operation for the built complete max-heaps .
