# Lab Work 01. NextDate() and Calendar

Note: Programming in C
 
## Work1. Implementation of NextDate()

NextDate() is a function of three variables: month, date, and year. It returns the date of the day after the input date. 

The month, date, and year variables have integer values subject to these conditions:
* C1: 1 ≤ month ≤ 12
* C2: 1 ≤ day ≤ 31
* C3: 1812 ≤ year ≤ 3000 

By the *Gregorian* calendar, 
*  A year is a leap year (which has 29 days in February) if it is divisible by 4, unless it is a century year. 
*  Century years are leap years only if they are multiples of 400.
	
Thus, 1992, 1996, and 2000 are leap years, while the year 1900 is not a leap year.
