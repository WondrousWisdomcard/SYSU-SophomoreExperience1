### Lab Work 08-1. Double Hashing

**Note**: Programming in C

Consider a hash table with M = 64 bins. Given a 12-bit unsigned number, take the lowest 6 bits as the primary hash function to get the bin number, and the highest 6 bits as the secondary hash function to get the jump size.
1. Determine the array structures for a hash table
2. Hash a list of 40 random 12-bit positive numbers
3. Calculate the average number of probes
