### Lab Work 09-1. Array Implementation of min-Heaps

**Note:** Programming in C

A complete min-heap is a min-heap with the structure of a complete binary tree which can be stored using an array.

1. Determine the array structures for a complete min-heap
2. Input a linear list of 20 random numbers, building a complete min-heap to store the numbers
3. Implement POP and PUSH operations for the min-heaps.
