### Lab Work 05-1. Application of Binary Trees

**Note**: Programming in C

A left-child-right-sibling binary tree (LCRS) is a binary tree used to store a general rooted ordered tree by the following consideration:

1. The first child of each node is its left subtree in LCRS
2. The next sibling of each node is its right subtree in LCRS

The transformation of a general rooted ordered tree into a LCRS binary tree has been called the *Knuth* Transform

1. Determine the data structures for general rooted ordered trees and binary trees
2. Implement the *Knuth* Transform in C
3. Show by examples that a post-order traversal of the original tree is identical to the in-order traversal of the Knuth Transform
