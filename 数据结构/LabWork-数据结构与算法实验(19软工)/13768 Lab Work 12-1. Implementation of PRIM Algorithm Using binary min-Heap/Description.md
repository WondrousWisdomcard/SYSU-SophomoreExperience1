### Lab Work 12-1. Implementation of PRIM Algorithm Using binary min-Heap

**Note:** Programming in C

Refer to the lecture in Prim's algorithm - Algorithm Analysis - An improvement using binary min-heap.

1. Represent the graph with an Adjacency List
2. Determine data structures for the binary min-heap of improved Prim's algorithm
3. Implement the improved Prim's algorithm using binary min-heap in C language.
