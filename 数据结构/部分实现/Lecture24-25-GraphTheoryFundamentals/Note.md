Theorem 25.
Let G = (V, E) be a non-empty, non-trivial graph. Then G has at least one pair of vertices with equal degree.

Lemma 30.
Let d = (d1, d2, ... dn) be a graphic degree sequence. Then there exists a graph G = (V,E) with V = {V1, V2 ... Vn} such that 
(1) deg(vi) = di
(2) vi is adjacent to vertices v2 .... v_{d_1 + 1}
